#Custom OnePlus Sound

A KernelSU module to modify annoying OnePlus default sound effects (likely) inherited from ColorOS.

Since that root is required, this module just saves you some time before next OTA update.

##Usage

Install the module, reboot, add files to `/data/adb/modules/customOplusUISound/system_ext/media/...`.

By default only `.../media/audio/Usb.ogg` is replaced by an empty track, since this annoys me most.
